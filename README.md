<h2>‚ú® My components</h2>
I was responsible for the GameChooseHUB module, which served as a choose-your-minigame type of menu. User can also see the chosen minigame's ranking.
<h3>GameTile</h3>
Represents a single game in the application. It displays the game's name and icon, and it also has a button to display the game's high scores. The component receives the game's name, icon, and a boolean indicating whether the button to play it is enabled as props. When the game's icon or title is clicked, the game starts.
<h3>GameChooseHUB</h3>
Here the user can choose a game to play. It displays a list of available games using the GameTile component. Each game is represented by a GameTile component.
